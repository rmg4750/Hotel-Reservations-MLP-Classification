# Hotel-Reservations-MLP-Classification

In this project I fit a multi-layer perceptron classification model on Hotel Reservation data.

We want to predict who will cancel or keep their booking based on booking data like number of days booked or room type. To do this I had to apply my data preprocessing knowledge in order to get the data ready for modeling. Once the data was ready we fit the model and tested the model's prediction accuracy on our data that we set aisde for testing and compared the results.

I hope to continue working on this project in the near future to improve model performance.
